### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use github and git
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with css and js.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything even thought i might not know the answer for it, i will put some work to find the right answer all the time.
âš¡ Fun fact: I can not sleep if i have a problem that i couldnt solve(maybe not a fun fact). I guess this might be the reason i am bold.(this is a fun fact imo :D)
